TO DO after working bot is created

# OrderManager Robustness Enhancement Plan

## Current Challenges

The OrderManager currently doesn't guarantee continuity across disconnections, shutdowns, or restarts. This creates several reliability gaps:

1. **Order State Persistence** - Orders in progress are lost when the bot restarts
2. **Execution Detection** - Can't determine if limit orders executed during downtime
3. **Position Tracking** - May lose track of open positions after disconnections
4. **Recovery Process** - No mechanism to recover and continue managing existing orders

## Enhancement Strategy

### 1. Persistent Order Storage
- Implement a local database (SQLite) to store all order details including:
  - Order IDs, symbols, quantities, prices, types
  - Current status and state transitions
  - Associated stop-loss and take-profit orders
  - Timestamps for all events
- Create schemas that support the complete order lifecycle
- Implement atomic transactions to prevent data corruption

### 2. Order Recovery Process
- On startup, load all incomplete orders from database
- Query Bybit API for current status of each order
- Reconcile local state with exchange state
- Handle various scenarios (filled while offline, partially filled, etc.)
- Re-establish monitoring for all active orders

### 3. State Machine Implementation
- Define a complete state machine for order lifecycle:
  - Created → Submitted → Accepted → Partial/Filled/Canceled/Rejected
  - Each state transition triggers appropriate actions
  - Record all state changes to database with timestamps
- Support complex order relationships (main order + TP/SL)

### 4. Active Reconciliation
- Implement a reconciliation loop that periodically:
  - Verifies all tracked orders against exchange data
  - Detects and resolves discrepancies
  - Updates database with current state
  - Triggers appropriate actions for state changes

### 5. Recovery Scenarios Handling
- Create specific logic for common failure scenarios:
  - API disconnection during order placement
  - Bot shutdown while orders are pending
  - Orders that fill during downtime
  - Partial fills requiring adjustment
  - Failed stop-loss or take-profit placements

### 6. WebSocket Optimization (client.py upgrades)
- Use WebSocket for real-time order updates when available
- Fall back to REST API polling when WebSocket is unavailable
- Implement intelligent reconnection with exponential backoff
- Maintain separate connection status tracking

### 7. Error Handling Improvements
- Enhanced error classification (temporary vs. permanent)
- Circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures
- Automatic retry strategies for recoverable errors
- Critical error alerting mechanism

## Implementation Approach

This enhancement would be implemented in phases:

1. **Database integration** - Add SQLite support with order schemas
2. **Basic persistence** - Store and recover simple order details
3. **State machine** - Implement full order lifecycle tracking
4. **Reconciliation** - Build the exchange verification process
5. **Recovery logic** - Add specialized handling for disconnection scenarios
6. **Testing** - Comprehensive testing of failure modes

The enhanced OrderManager will provide a robust foundation for reliable trading operations, maintaining accurate state even through connectivity issues, restarts, and unexpected shutdowns.
